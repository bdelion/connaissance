My name's Emily! I'm primarily an engineer, but I'm also an artist, learner, teacher, adventurer, and a lover of France and of the French language. Language is probably the coolest thing about being a person. Accordingly, Connaissance is a collection of the French turns of phrase I learn per day. Sources include conversation, Twitter, textbooks, novels, and coworkers.

Don't hesitate to [get in touch](https://twitter.com/eclairereese) if you're also interested in the French language and how we can better share the things we know!
